## üîß Technical Approach  
### Workflow of the Real-Time Misinformation Detection System  
![truthtell hackathon diagram (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2db9564-4c5a-4988-9d2c-4b388ef90d7c)


1. **Data Ingestion (Apache Kafka)**  
   - Live broadcast data is ingested in real time via Apache Kafka.  
   - Kafka ensures low-latency data transfer between the NLP pipeline and the dashboard.  

2. **Data Processing and NLP (Python, Spark Streaming, NLP Tools)**  
   - Data is pre-processed with Spark Streaming, cleaned, and tokenized.  
   - NLP models (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers with TensorFlow) analyze text for entities, sentiment, and misinformation patterns.  
   - Pre-trained models like BERT and GPT are fine-tuned on custom datasets for complex tasks such as sentiment analysis and context extraction.  

3. **Fact-Checking and Database Lookup (PostgreSQL, Fact-Checking APIs)**  
   - Claims are cross-referenced with databases (PostgreSQL/MongoDB) and verified through fact-checking APIs.  
   - Results, including confidence scores, are stored for retrieval and analysis.  

4. **Real-Time Dashboard (Plotly, D3.js, Dash, JavaScript)**  
   - A dynamic dashboard visualizes analyzed data, confidence scores, sources, and alerts.  
   - Interactive features enable broadcasters to respond to flagged content in real time.  

5. **Cloud Deployment and Scalability (AWS)**  
   - The system is hosted on AWS for scalability and real-time processing as user demand increases.

## üé® User Interface & Interaction  

### Features:  
1. **Real-Time Alerts & Notifications**  
   - Flags claims with visual indicators (e.g., red for high misinformation probability, yellow for unclear, green for verified).  
   - Alerts include confidence scores and relevant sources for broadcaster review.  

2. **Deeper Insights**  
   - Provides users with insights into the causes, effects, and psychology behind misinformation.  
   - Offers explanations through key theories:  
     - **Rumor Theory**: Influence of ambiguity and anxiety.  
     - **Rhetorical Theory**: Examines belief structures around misinformation.  
     - **Third-Person Effect**: Studies collective rumor behavior.  
     - **Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT)**: Government communication during crises.  
     - **Reputation Theory**: Cognitive biases in content evaluation.
